      "content": "\r\nHey everyone! I wanted to share my journey of learning web development and discovering amazing tools like Cursor along the way.\r\n\r\n## Starting with Web Development\r\n\r\nMy web development journey began with the basics - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I remember the excitement of creating my first webpage and seeing it come alive in the browser. As I progressed, I discovered modern frameworks like React and Next.js that completely changed how I build web applications.\r\n\r\n## Discovering Cursor IDE\r\n\r\nOne of the game-changing moments in my journey was finding Cursor IDE. As a student learning to code, having an AI-powered assistant has been incredibly helpful. Here's how Cursor has helped me:\r\n\r\n- Quick explanations of complex concepts\r\n- Code suggestions that helped me learn best practices\r\n- Debugging assistance when I'm stuck\r\n- Learning new patterns and approaches\r\n\r\n## Current Learning Path\r\n\r\nI'm currently focusing on:\r\n- Advanced React patterns\r\n- TypeScript integration\r\n- Server-side rendering with Next.js\r\n- API design and implementation\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more updates on my learning journey! ðŸš€"
